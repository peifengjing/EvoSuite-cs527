Item_ESTest
  test02
    This test is wrong caused by EvoSuite. The type of item0 and item1 are both "ClassWriter.INT"
    and their intVal are the same. But the test expects them to be different.
Cache_ESTest
  test3
    This test fails because the code fails to catch empty list exception. The method
    "loadM2EdgesFromCache" fails if the input list "moreEdges" is empty.
EkstaziHelper_ESTest
  test1
    This test failure is caused by timeout parameter in the annotation. The test will succeed if the
    time out parameters is removed. This failure does not appear in "mvn test" process but comes up
    in the code coverage analysis.
  test2
    This is the same failure type as the EsktaziHelper_ESTest.test1
  test5
    This is the same failure type as the EsktaziHelper_ESTest.test1
Loadables_ESTest
  test01
    This test failure is caused by failing to catch the FileNotFound Exception when using
    DirectedGraph.fromGiraphString. The code should catch the exception if the file does not
    exist, or the ES test should create the file before calling the method.
  test04
    This test failure is caused by timeout parameter in the annotation. The test will succeed if the
    time out parameters is removed. This failure does not appear in "mvn test" process but comes up
    in the code coverage analysis.
  test05
    This test failure is the same as Loadables_ESTest.test01
  test06
    This test failure is the same as Loadables_ESTest.test01
  test07
    This test failure is the same as Loadables_ESTest.test01
  test11
    This test failure is the same as Loadables_ESTest.test04
  test13
    This test failure is the same as Loadables_ESTest.test04
  test14
    This test failure is the same as Loadables_ESTest.test04
  test19
    This test failure is the same as Loadables_ESTest.test01
YasglHelper_ESTest
  test05
    This test failure is caused by timeout parameter in the annotation. The test will succeed if the
    time out parameters is removed. This failure does not appear in "mvn test" process but comes up
    in the code coverage analysis.
  test20
    This test failure is caused by failing to catch the FileNotFound Exception when using
    DirectedGraph.fromGiraphString. The code should catch the exception if the file does not
    exist, or the ES test should create the file before calling the method.
  test21
    This test failure is caused by failing to catch the FileNotFound Exception when using
    DirectedGraph.fromGiraphString. The code should catch the exception if the file does not
    exist, or the ES test should create the file before calling the method.
ZLCHelper_ESTest
  test3
    This test failure is caused by catching the NoSuchFile Exception in ZLCHelper.java:136. It is
    the incorrect test generation by EvoSuite because it should create a mock file before calling
    the methods.
